<p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Arial"><big>A volcano is a crack in the earth's crust through which lava, volcanic ash, and gases can escape. Dissolved gas pressure contributes to volcanic eruptions. Under a volcano, liquid magma containing dissolved gases rises through cracks in the Earth's crust. As the magma rises, the pressure decreases, allowing gases to form bubbles. When magma (lava) reaches the surface, its behaviour is determined by its gas content as well as its chemical composition. As layers of rock and ash build-up from repeated eruptions, volcanoes often form a hill or mountain.</font></big></p></div>
